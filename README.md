# Hello, folks!  ðŸ‘‹

My name is Paridhi Jain and I'm a final year Ungergraduate student persuing my Bachelor's of engineering from V.V.P Engineering College,Rajkot. I would like to showcase what I have contributed in 3 years of my engineering as a developer and in technical field.

âœ” I am working as a Core tech team member of <b>Developers Student Club.</b>

âœ” I have worked as a Data Analyst Intern at <b>The Sparks Foundation.</b>

âœ” I have worked as an Executive Counsellor at <b>Careers360.</b>

## What am I learning right now?

Well, I think a developer has to learn new skills every single day of his/her life. And It is more important to practice them rather than just learning endlessly. 

- I am currently learning <b>Web developement with MERN stack.</b>
- I have made some frontend projects with <b>React.js framework.</b>
- I am practicing <b>Deep learning Concepts.</b>
- I am working on some projects related to <b>OpenCV with python.</b>
